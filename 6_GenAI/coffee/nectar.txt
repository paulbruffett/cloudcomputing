The Nectar Blend is our take on a contemporary house espresso, the perfect light blend for everyday enjoyment. This blend is designed to shine in milk-based beverages or as a standalone espresso, offering a sweet, medium-bodied cup with a noticeably fruity backbone.

This delicious blend consists of a yellow honey-processed Honduran lot that makes up 60% of the blend, and the remaining 40% is our Natural Ethiopia Ardi. The Honduran beans add a creamy and sweet body, while the Ethiopian beans contribute rich fruitiness, texture, and a fresh acidity that is never sour.

Light roasted to perfection, our Nectar Blend is designed for ease and consistency, making it effortless to achieve a flawless cup every time you brew. The beans are selected and roasted to bring out their inherent characteristics, ensuring a smooth and nuanced profile that delights the palate.

We taste honey in a creamy, sweet body with berry-like acidity. üçØ

Whether you prefer to enjoy its complex flavors on their own or paired with milk, Nectar Blend offers a versatile canvas for your coffee ritual. Elevate your coffee moments with a blend that promises sweetness, balance, and a touch of artisanal craftsmanship in every sip.

At Blossom Coffee Roasters, crafting the perfect balance is our passion. We carefully adjust the ratios of these single-origin beans throughout the year to ensure consistency and excellence in every batch of Nectar Blend. Frequent cupping and tasting sessions guarantee that each new lot maintains the blend's signature profile‚Äîsmooth, nuanced, and utterly satisfying.
