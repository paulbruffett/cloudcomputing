Our Dark Side of the Moon blend is fast becoming a favorite of restaurants and bakeries for its ability to complement food perfectly. Just dark enough to satisfy dark roast fans, yet without the carbon flavors that often accompany medium-dark roasts, this blend offers a rich and balanced coffee experience. 

This blend features a combination of washed Guatemalan and natural Ethiopian beans, providing a perfect balance of fruity and clean notes. The blend's depth and richness make it a versatile choice for various brewing methods, delivering a satisfying cup every time. We enjoy Dark Side as a revitalizing morning drip as well as a delicious espresso in milk drinks. 

Medium-dark roasted to perfection, our Dark Side of the Moon blend is designed for ease and consistency, making it effortless to achieve a flawless brew. The beans are selected and roasted to bring out their inherent characteristics, ensuring a smooth and nuanced profile that delights the palate.

We taste dark chocolate and stewed blueberries, a perfect balance of refreshing and sweet. ðŸŒ‘

Whether you prefer to enjoy its complex flavors on their own or paired with your favorite desserts, Dark Side of the Moon offers a versatile canvas for your coffee ritual. Elevate your coffee moments with a blend that promises richness, balance, and a touch of artisanal craftsmanship in every sip.

At Blossom Coffee Roasters, crafting the perfect balance is our passion. We carefully adjust the ratios of these single-origin beans throughout the year to ensure consistency and excellence in every batch of Dark Side of the Moon. Frequent cupping and tasting sessions guarantee that each new lot maintains the blend's signature profileâ€”smooth, nuanced, and utterly satisfying.
