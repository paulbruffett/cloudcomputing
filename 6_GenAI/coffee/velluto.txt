Our Espresso Velluto blend is thoughtfully crafted from Ethiopian, Guatemalan, and Sumatran single-origin coffees. This unique combination of beans is carefully selected to achieve a perfect balance of sweet and earthy notes, creating a blend that's not only delightful as a standalone espresso but also shines when paired with steamed milk in your favorite coffee drinks.

Our Colombian beans undergo fully-washed process, resulting in a light and clean body that forms the backbone of this blend. Meanwhile, the Ethiopian beans, processed naturally, impart vibrant red fruit notes that add a lively sweetness to every sip. Finally, our wet-hulled Sumatran beans contribute earthy tones and a creamy body that enriches the blend with depth and texture.

Light to medium roasted to perfection, our Espresso Velluto is designed for ease and consistency, making it effortless to achieve a flawless espresso shot every time you brew. The beans are selected and roasted to bring out their inherent characteristics, ensuring a smooth and nuanced profile that delights the palate.

We taste classic dark stone fruit notes in a smooth body, perfectly balanced. ðŸ¦‹
