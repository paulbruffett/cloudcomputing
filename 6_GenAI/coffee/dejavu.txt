Our Déjà Vu blend is a classic example of everything great about coffee. Formerly known as Vashon Vienna, this blend is composed of washed Colombian and wet-hulled Sumatran beans, medium-roasted to bring out a rich chocolate flavor and smooth body.

Our Colombian beans undergo a fully washed process, resulting in a clean and chocolatey profile that forms the backbone of this blend. Meanwhile, the wet-hulled Sumatran beans contribute earthy tones and a creamy body that enriches the blend with depth and texture.

Our Déjà Vu blend is designed for ease and consistency, making it effortless to achieve a flawless cup every time you brew. Delicious as an easy cup of drip and complex and chocolatey as a shot of espresso, the beans in this blend are selected and roasted to bring out their inherent characteristics, ensuring a smooth and nuanced profile that delights the palate.

We taste rich chocolate and burnt sugars with a big, balanced body. ☕

Whether you prefer to enjoy its complex flavors on their own or paired with your favorite treats, Déjà Vu offers a versatile canvas for your coffee ritual. Elevate your coffee moments with a blend that promises richness, balance, and a touch of artisanal craftsmanship in every sip.

At Blossom Coffee Roasters, crafting the perfect balance is our passion. We carefully adjust the ratios of these single-origin beans throughout the year to ensure consistency and excellence in every batch of Déjà Vu. Frequent cupping and tasting sessions guarantee that each new lot maintains the blend's signature profile—smooth, nuanced, and utterly satisfying.
