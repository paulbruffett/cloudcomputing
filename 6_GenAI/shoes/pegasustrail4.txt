The Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GORE-TEX is your running companion for those days when the weather turns. Its waterproof GORE-TEX layer helps keep your feet dry, and less rubber in the outsole creates a smooth transition from road to trail without breaking stride.

Keep the Rain Away
GORE-TEX along the upper helps your feet stay dry from precipitation without sacrificing that comfortable feel of the Peg Trail. Its flexible, lightweight design helps keep out the rain when running between the wet roads and trails.

When the Rubber Hits the Trail
Less rubber along the outsole creates a smooth transition from road to trail while preserving the full-length React midsole. The rubber outsole wraps around the front of the shoe to provide extra durability. A generative traction pattern combined with rubber in the forefoot provides extra grip for technical trails while maintaining a smooth ride for the road.

React in the Weather
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. Its full-length design provides stability as you brave rocky terrain.

Keeping Out the Little Things
Updated materials around the ankle help ensure water and trail debris don't get into the shoe.
