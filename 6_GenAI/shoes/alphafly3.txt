Fine-tuned for marathon speed, the Alphafly 3 helps push you beyond what you thought possible. Three innovative technologies power your run: A double dose of Air Zoom units helps launch you into your next step; a full-length carbon fiber plate helps propel you forward with ease; and a heel-to-toe ZoomX foam midsole helps keep you fresh from start to 26.2. Time to leave your old personal records in the dust.

Energy Return for Your Marathon
Two forefoot Air Zoom units combine with ZoomX foam to store and return the energy back to you, powering every step.

Propulsive Feeling
A full-length carbon fiber plate delivers a propulsive sensation that helps you smoothly transition through every stride and tackle turns with confidence.

Cushioned Ride
Fully connected ZoomX foam creates an ultralight and cushioned feel, helping you stay fresh and comfortable from mile 1 to 26.2.

What's New About the Alphafly 3?
The Alphafly 3 is our lightest Alphafly ever, featuring a slightly wider carbon fiber plate for increased stability, a fully connected ZoomX foam midsole for smoother transitions and an all-new Atomknit upper designed for improved multidirectional containment and breathability.

More Benefits
Notched laces offer a secure but soft lace-up.
An integrated knit tongue with lofted padding helps alleviate lace pressure.
